# Geocoding
The project allows you to add contact information, with their address, through a form. It has a login page and allows authorized users to view all the contacts with their addresses present on a map as a marker, with the tooltip of the marker containing the contact information. The rows of the table containing contact information is clickable and centers the map to the marker of the contact. In the contacts page, you also have the option to Update, or Delete contacts. Delete is implemented as an AJAX request.

The Project uses JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MongoDB, Mapbox APIs, and Jade.
